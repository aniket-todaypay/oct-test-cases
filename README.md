# OCT Unit Test Cases with Ginkgo

This repository contains unit test cases implemented using Ginkgo for testing OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) software components.

## Overview

Ginkgo is a BDD-style testing framework for Go (Golang) programming language. It provides expressive and easy-to-read specs to write your tests in a more natural language style.

In this repository, we utilize Ginkgo to test various functionalities and modules of OCT software, ensuring robustness and reliability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the unit tests, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Go (Golang) - [Installation Guide](https://golang.org/doc/install)

### Installation

To install Ginkgo and necessary dependencies, run the following command:
